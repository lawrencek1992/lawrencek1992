This site was built using html and css and bootstrap. 

The nighttime landscape is styled using css shapes (triangles and trapezoids), while the moon and stars are a combination of css circles and box shadows. The the flicker affect on the stars is achieved by using a css animation on the stars at different intervals. There are actually only four stars. The other stars are box shadows, and they flicker in time with the star they are the shadow of. 

I styled the majority of the page before adding bootstrap. I added bootstrap in order to use their modals, which I styled to match my site. The blur effect behind the modals is not a bootstrap effect, I added that myself when I was styling my modals. The "!important" use in the .btn-close class was necessary to override some of the original bootstrap styling on that element.
